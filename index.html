			<h3>Information Communication Technology (ICT) Advisor
			<br>WELLINGTON GIRLS' COLLEGE</h3>

			<p>January 2012 - December 2014</p>

			<p>
				As an advisor I supported staff in their use of ICT, both for administration and classroom use. My main focus was helping teaching staff integrate Moodle and Google Apps for Education into their teaching and learning practices. I provided ongoing training for staff in ICT as well as ran specific training sessions for both staff and student groups. During 2013 I was involved in the development of the Staff Portal, which is used for dissemination of information as well as ongoing training in Moodle. Throughout 2014 I was instrumental in creating Wellington Girls' College themed Google Sites for use within the school community:
